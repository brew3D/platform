# Brew3D

Infrastructure for game development teams.

## Positioning

Brew3D is built for indie developers and small teams who already use commercial engines. It focuses on coordination, clarity, and shipping—not replacing your engine.

## For Contributors & Deployments

- **Stack:** Next.js (App Router), Node, optional backend services.
- **Run locally:** Copy `env.example` to `.env.local`, fill required keys, then `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
- **CI:** Lint and build run on push/PR to `main` (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- **Deploy:** Recommended: [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (free tier). Connect the repo and set environment variables in the project dashboard.
