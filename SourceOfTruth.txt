Brew3D — Product, Architecture & Execution Document (Grounded Version)
Positioning (lock this in):
Brew3D is not a game engine.
Brew3D is the infrastructure, brain, and CI/CD system for game development, with AI deeply integrated.

1. Core Philosophy (This Is the Anchor)
What Brew3D IS
The single source of truth for a game project
The place where context, assets, decisions, and builds live together
A game-aware CI/CD platform
An AI-powered control tower for Unreal / Unity projects
What Brew3D IS NOT (for now)
❌ A replacement for Unreal or Unity
❌ A physics engine
❌ A custom renderer
❌ A mesh / animation editor
Engines already exist. Studios struggle with coordination, reproducibility, and shipping. Brew3D fixes that.

2. Target User (Phase 1)
Primary User
Indie developers
Small teams (1–5 people)
Already using Unreal or Unity
Feeling pain around:
"works on my machine"
asset chaos
broken builds
lost context
AI that can’t understand their project
Explicitly NOT targeting (yet)
AAA studios
Marketing agencies
Beginners with no engine experience

3. High-Level System Model
Every Brew3D project has two linked but separate layers:
A. Brew3D Cloud Project (Owned by Brew3D)
Game flow
Asset registry
Metadata
Design docs
AI memory
Test & build history
B. Engine Project (Owned by the Engine)
Unreal / Unity project
Physics
Scripts
Engine configs
Runtime logic
Brew3D wraps around the engine project. It does not replace it.

4. Core Feature Areas (MVP → v1)

4.1 Project Hub (Mandatory)
The landing page for every game.
Features:
Project overview
Target engine (Unreal / Unity)
Connected repo status
Last successful build
Last failed build
Active collaborators
This is the home base.

4.2 Flow (The Game Brain)
This is Brew3D’s biggest differentiator.
Purpose:
Represent the game at a conceptual level
Preserve intent and reasoning
Features:
Flow graphs (levels, states, transitions)
Mechanics breakdown (e.g. shooting = input → raycast → collision → damage)
Player journey mapping
AI-readable structure
AI Capabilities:
Explain how the game works
Detect missing logic
Suggest next steps
Map flow → engine concepts

4.3 Asset Registry (Not Editing)
Assets are tracked, not authored here.
Features:
Upload assets (models, audio, textures)
Link external assets (Marketplace, Sketchfab, etc.)
License tracking (free vs paid)
Usage tracking (where asset is used)
Preview via GLB / GLTF
Important:
No mesh editing
No animation editing
Preview-only

4.4 Scene & Map Preview
Purpose: Review and understand scenes without opening the engine.
Features:
GLB / GLTF scene preview
Camera controls
Annotations & comments
AI explanations of scene structure
This is a lens, not an editor.

4.5 Scripts (Orchestration Layer)
Scripts are engine-native, not Brew3D-native.
Features:
Read-only browsing of code / Blueprints
Diff viewing between builds
AI explanations of scripts
AI-proposed patches (never silent changes)
All real changes go back as git commits.

5. Engine-Backed Preview (Critical Feature)
What “Run Preview” Means
Brew3D spins up a clean cloud VM
Installs exact engine version
Pulls engine repo
Syncs assets
Runs Play-in-Editor or equivalent
Streams video + input to browser
Technologies:
Cloud GPU
WebRTC / Pixel Streaming
Result:
Real physics
Real gameplay
Real scripts
No "works on my machine"

6. Game CI/CD (The Infra Win)
Brew3D provides:
Deterministic builds
Reproducible environments
Build logs
Crash logs
Video recordings of test runs
Triggers:
Manual
Git commit
AI change
This is CI/CD for game dev.

7. AI Agent (“Mug”)
What Mug Does
Understands the entire project
Reads flow, assets, scripts, logs
Diagnoses failures
Proposes fixes
Explains decisions
What Mug Does NOT Do
One-shot generate full games
Modify code without approval
Replace human judgment
Mug is a collaborator, not a magician.

8. Docs & Knowledge Base
Integrated documentation (Confluence-style, but game-aware).
Features:
Design docs
Lore
Technical decisions
AI-linked references to code & flow
This prevents context loss.

9. Versioning Model (Non-Git Mental Model)
Users see:
Timeline
Snapshots
Rollbacks
Diffs explained in plain English
Under the hood:
Git
LFS
Engine-native files

10. What You Should NOT Build Now
❌ Custom physics
❌ Full 3D editor
❌ Shader graph
❌ Animation tools
❌ Marketing-focused features

11. Long-Term Vision (Park This)
The Brew Engine (Future)
Deep engine integration
In-engine AI co-builder
Native editor extensions
Only after:
Hundreds of studios
Proven infra
Clear demand

12. Execution Order (Very Important)
Phase 1 (Now)
Project hub
Flow system
Asset registry
Engine repo linking
Engine-backed preview
Phase 2
AI diagnostics
CI automation
Better preview tooling
Phase 3
Native shell
Studio features

Final Truth
You were right to think big.
You are now right to stay grounded.
Brew3D wins by:
Owning infra
Owning context
Letting engines do engine things
This document is your execution north star.
Do not violate it lightly
